<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although  only temporal data assimilation (DA)  has been explored in depth in the
prototype EO-LDAS tool, it was noted in Lewis et al. (2012a,b) that the tool should
be capable of spatial, as well as temporal DA. The purpose of this technical note is to
demonstrate the spatial capabilities of the tool and to show how multi-(spatial)
resolution DA can be achieved.</p>
<p>To illustrate these concepts, we develop from the regularisation of NDVI data
example in the EO-LDAS tutorial (<a class="reference external" href="http://jgomezdans.github.com/eoldas_examples">www1</a>).  In this example, we demonstrate the
concept of using regularisation (by a zero-order process model) to  smooth and
interpolate a noisy data sequence (that we suppose to be NDVI). The data in the
experiment are synthetic, i.e. generated from a known truth.
The experiment is run from a python code  (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/solve_eoldas_identity.py">www2</a>) that generates the synthetic
dataset, adds a significant amount of noise (standard deviation 0.15). Correlated gaps
(mimicking clouds) are introduced into the data. In the example given 33% of the
observations are removed. The results are shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/example1plot12.png" src="_images/example1plot12.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig 1: Smoothing a noisy time series with temporal DA.</p>
</div>
<p>The blue dots show the input data, with associated uncertainty (1.95 <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>, i.e. the
95% confidence interval (C.I)). The ‘truth’ a half sine wave with a flat section is
shown as the green line. The retrieved state is shown as the red line (mean) and grey
bounds (95% C.I.). This is a suitable example to demonstrate the principles of
temporal data assimilation with two constraints: (i) the noisy observations; and (ii) a
simple (zero-order process model). Although some problems are encountered at
sudden changes (the transition between the sine wave and the flat time), the form of
the underlying function is well reconstructed from the noisy samples. In this case, the
observation operator, i.e. the operator that translates between the space of the state we
are trying to estimate here (NDVI) and the observations (NDVI) is an identity
operator. This is chosen to make a fast experiment and to demonstrate principles.
There is no attempt to optimise the ‘smoothness’ (gamma) term in this and following
experiments. Instead, we take a theoretical value from the truth and reduce it by a
factor of 5 (so we should generally be under-smoothing).</p>
<p>The EO-LDAS tool is accessed in this example through (i) a configuration file; (ii) a
command-line to override some of the settings in a generic configuration file. The
command line is set as:</p>
<img alt="_images/config1_screeny.png" src="_images/config1_screeny.png" />
<p>and the (generic) configuration file given in (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/config_files/Identity.conf">www3</a>. In the configuration file, we
declare the ‘location’ specification to be ‘time’ and specify the parameters we wish to
solve for (NDVI here).</p>
<img alt="_images/config2_screeny.png" src="_images/config2_screeny.png" />
<p>and set up the differential operator (in time):</p>
<img alt="_images/config3_screeny.png" src="_images/config3_screeny.png" />
<p>and the (Identity) observation operator:</p>
<img alt="_images/config4_screeny.png" src="_images/config4_screeny.png" />
<p>In further examples in the tutorial and in Lewis et al. (2012a,b) we go on to show how
more complex observation operators (such as a radiative transfer model) can be used
in the DA so that vegetation state variables (LAI etc.) can be estimated from remote
reflectance observations. The principle of the underlying (zero- or first-order) process
models is the same as in the simple NDVI example.</p>
<p>The example is also interesting in its own right, as a demonstration of optimal
filtering, i.e. smoothing with a target, multi-constraint cost function. It also shows
how uncertainty can be calculated in such an optimal estimation framework.</p>

<div class="section" id="spatial-data-assimilation">
<h2>Spatial data assimilation<a class="headerlink" href="#spatial-data-assimilation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Spatial data assimilation proceeds in exactly the same way as temporal DA when we
use these simple process models. In fact, instead of considering the x-axis in figure 1
as time, we could simply state that it is a transect in space and all of the same results
and conclusions would apply. In the spatial sense, we might consider this to be quite
similar to what is done in optimal spatial interpolation schemes such as kriging or
regression kriging (where some low order model is fitted and the difference constraint
operates on the residuals of that model) (<a class="reference external" href="http://spatial-analyst.net/wiki/index.php?title=Regression-kriging_guide">www4</a>).</p>
<p>Python code for performing a spatial DA is given in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/solve_eoldas_spatial.py">www5</a>. It is very much based on
that for the temporal DA discussed above, but now we generate a synthetic dataset in two dimensions:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_clean1.png" src="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_clean1.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2: Synthetic 2D (spatial) dataset</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 2 shows the spatial dataset generated in this code. It contains some 2-D sine
waves and flat areas. The test data lies between the values 0 and 1 and represents
NDVI, which one could imagine as representing say 4 ‘fields’ here, two with crops in
and two bare soil. In such an imagining, we can see spatial variation in the NDVI
(vegetation density) within the fields.
Noise, of sigma 0.15 is added to these data, and again 33% of the samples removed.
The input dataset then is shown in figure 3.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_data1.png" src="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_data1.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3: Sampled synthetic 2D (spatial) dataset</p>
</div>
<p>We can again suppose the ‘holes’ in the observations to be representative of clouds.
The configuration file for this experiment is given in <cite>www6 &lt;https://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/config_files/IdentitySpatial.conf&gt;</cite>.
In setting up a spatial DA in EO-LDAS, we declare the location to be ‘row’ and ‘col’:</p>
<img alt="_images/config5_screeny.png" src="_images/config5_screeny.png" />
<p>We then define two differential operators, one in row and the other in column space:</p>
<img alt="_images/config6_screeny.png" src="_images/config6_screeny.png" />
<p>The observation operator is as in the previous example.
The result of running the DA is an estimate of the NDVI for all sample locations:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_fwd1.png" src="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_fwd1.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4: Result of DA (mean)</p>
</div>
<p>which is our posterior estimate of NDVI obtained from the samples given in figure 3.
It is our ‘optimal estimate’ of the original data (figure 2) and does a very reasonable
job of this. The uncertainty in this estimate is given by:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_fwdsd1.png" src="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_fwdsd1.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5: Result of DA (sd)</p>
</div>
<p>Recall that the uncertainty in the input data was 0.15. Where we have sampled data,
this has been reduced (by the DA/regularisation) to around 0.06, and in the gaps (i.e.
under the clouds) the uncertainty is around 0.075. The fidelity of this reconstruction is
perhaps better illustrated by taking a transect through the dataset:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_transect1.png" src="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params_transect1.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6: Transect through dataset at row 13</p>
</div>
<p>The input data are shown as green dots, and the reconstruction given as the red line,
with cyan (95%) C.I.s. The original data (i.e. what we are trying to reconstruct) is the
blue line. As with the temporal example in figure 1, this does a remarkably good job.
A scatterplot of the true (x axis) and retrieved (y-axis with 95% CI as green errorbars)
is shown in figure 7:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params1.png" src="_images/NDVI_Identity_spatial.params1.png" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7: Scatterplot of retrieved (y-axis) against true (x-axis) NDVI over all  spatial samples</p>
</div>
<p>The scatterplot reveals a slight bias in the retrieved NDVI for high NDVI values,
which is probably a result of the small number of high values in the input dataset and
the type of smoothing used). It may just be a feature of the assumption of stationarity
in the smoothness term. If you compare the high NDVI values in figures 2 and 4 you
can see this same issue, although it is relatively minor in the grand scheme of things.
Certainly the 95% C.I. covers the extent of the true data, so the C.I. is likely slightly
over-estimated here.</p>

<div class="section" id="multi-resolution-data-assimilation">
<h2>Multi-resolution data assimilation<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-resolution-data-assimilation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can proceed from this example to consider multi-spatial resolution DA within
EO-LDAS. Although we do not have any sensor spatial transfer functions within the
prototype, we can demonstrate and explore the principles within the existing tool.
This can be done by simply mapping a coarser spatial resolution dataset to the grid of
a higher resolution dataset. To account for the fact that the sample observations will
then be used multiple times within the existing DA, we can simply inflate the
apparent uncertainty of each sample that we load.</p>
<p>Code to achieve this is given in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/solve_eoldas_spatial2a.py">www7</a>. In this, we generate two datasets, one at ‘full’
resolution, with an uncertainty of 0.15 and with 33% of the observations missing, and
one at a linear scale of 1/4 th, i.e. where 16 pixels at high resolution represent one pixel
at coarse resolution. The filter window size used to correlate the data gaps is 3 in this
example (larger filter sizes will result in larger gaps). The uncertainty in the coarse
resolution data is 0.0375, so less than that at high resolution (by a factor of 4) but then
we re-inflate it to an apparent uncertainty of 0.15 when applying the same (coarse)
resolution sample pixel over the high-resolution grid.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/NDVI_multires_panel11.png" src="_images/NDVI_multires_panel11.png" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 9: Transect through row 13 of results for 1/3 data missing</p>
</div>
<p>As in other examples in EO-LDAS, we use separate observation operators for the
different data streams, though this is largely for convenience in this case as the both
data sets are associated with Identity operators in this case.
These results demonstrate the ability of the code to achieve a multi-resolution DA
(albeit with a simple Identity observation operator here). With 1/3rd of the samples
missing, the results are very good, although we note that the specifics of the ‘gap’
algorithm used here mean that gaps tend to be created at the edge of the image first
(this is to do with how a random noise field is filtered to create the gappiness). There
is no apparent bias in the results (figure 8f), and effective use is made of both the
high- and low-resolution datasets to provide a viable (and in this case accurate)
posterior estimate (figure 8b).</p>
<p>In a second example, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/solve_eoldas_spatial2b.py">www8</a>, we consider the case where 2/3 of the data are missing,
with a larger filter size (6) resulting in larger gaps. The results are clearly of
somewhat lower quality, but this is reflected in the uncertainties. The uncertainty map
(figure 10e) clearly demonstrates where the sampling in the input data (in both high
and low resolution datasets) is poor (light blue). Unsurprisingly, where we have
samples in both high and low spatial resolution datasets, the uncertainty is lowest.
Given the amount of extrapolation in this exercise, the results are remarkably good.
There is no apparent bias in the results (visually, from figure 10f). The transect in
figure 11 shows that though the reconstruction is still perhaps a little noisy (it could
most likely tolerate a higher gamma) it provides a faithful reconstruction of the
original data from noisy multi-resolution datasets with large gaps.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 11: Transect through row 13 of results for 2/3 data missing</p>
</div>
<p>In a final example (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jgomezdans/eoldas_examples/blob/master/solve_eoldas_spatial2c.py">www9</a>), we remove 2/3rd of the samples from the high-resolution
image, but only 1/3rd of the lower resolution data. This is an attempt to mimic the
impact of higher frequency low spatial observations with occasional high-resolution
data (though we do not directly consider the time dimension in this example). In this
case, we have only sparse coverage at high resolution, but good coverage of most of
the major features at low resolution. There is minimal ‘blockiness’ in the DA result in
figure 12b, but even this does not seem very apparent in the transect (figure 13). The
better coverage provided by the low resolution data produces much less scatter when
comparing to the original signal (compare figures 10f and 12f). The result compares
very favourably with that in figure 8 which had twice as many high resolution
samples.</p>
