=============================================

Contents:

The EOLDAS project is funded by ESA as part of the Support to Science Element (STSE) of the Earth observation Envelope Programme.
    
The aims of the projects are:
        
* To develop and document a generic data assimilation scheme to assist the retrieval of geophysical parameters from medium resolution optical EO data
* To develop a prototype software package implementing selected aspects of the scheme
* To validate the prototype using multi-sensor EO data and field measurements

The project is led by the UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) with a team that includes:
            
            The University of Reading
