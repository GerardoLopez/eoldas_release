<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document provides a guide to concepts of Data Assimilation (DA) and the use
of the EOLDAS prototype software.</p>
<p>EOLDAS is written in Python and provides an easy way to implement and test out advanced DA concepts.
It should be portable to most computer systems with a sane Python installation and a FORTRAN compiler.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the EOLDAS software is to allow the optimal estimation of (mainly land surface,
mainly vegetation) state variables (e.g. quantifying how much vegetation there is at a
particular time and place) from remote radiometric (Earth Observation) data.</p>
<p>A secondary task, that will be further explored in a follow on project and within <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nceo.ac.uk/">NCEO</a>
is to allow us to use Earth Observation data to test and constrain physical models of
how we think our environment &#8216;works&#8217;, encoded as what me can call &#8216;process models&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is not an easy task, as there is generally not enough &#8216;information&#8217; in our observations alone to
enable a &#8216;good estimate&#8217; of vegetation quantities from space-based observations.
In any case, whatever approach we take, we want to be able to
have an idea of how &#8216;good&#8217; our estimate is.</p>
<p>We find that Data Assimilation, an optimal estimation framework
allows us to apply multiple constraints in a consistent manner to achieve our aim.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the problem we are trying to solve with an EOLDAS<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-the-problem-we-are-trying-to-solve-with-an-eoldas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In recent years, monitoring of the Land surface
has received great attention. Accurate estimates of the state of the vegetation,
snow cover or disturbance are required by scientists and decision-makers in
fields as diverse as environmental science, disaster monitoring or food security.
Earth Observation (EO) data, being (mostly) radiometric measurements from instruments on satellite platforms,
have great potential to to contribute to such monitoring. Further, we have historical archives of
EO data over several decades that allow us to start to build a picture of how physical properties
on the Earth surface have been changing. We can then use these data for instance to test the accuracy
and robustness of &#8216;models&#8217; that are implementations of our current understanding of how people
and the Earth System interact. We can then contribute to improving these modelsand improving
our understanding.</p>
<p>The main advantage that EO has is that it is ia consistent source of information
(provided instrument calibration is understood and monitored) and can often provide global coverage.
In a sense, it is &#8216;objective&#8217; (within the limits of the orbital and physical measurement constraints
imposed on it), and it is also (certainly for the user at leasti, and also arguably because of the
coverage it provides) generally quite a cheap source of information. Probably one of the most
common use of land surface EO data that the general public come into contact with is that
available through sources such as Google Earth. Such data provide &#8216;visual&#8217; information to the
user, and with a little &#8216;photo interpretation&#8217;, many properties of the land surafce can be inferred.</p>
<p>The problem we have here though is to &#8216;automatically&#8217; provide reliable and constent information
from such data for global coverage: we want to quantify the properties of the land surface, not
just to describe it.  The EO data that we have access to do not directly provide the information we want.
If we want to improve models of e.g. how vegetation interacts with climate, we need
to connect the radiometric information to what we can call model &#8216;state variables&#8217;: things that the models
have a representation of, such as the amount of leaf area per unit land area. This implies
some sort of inference.</p>
<p>Traditionally in land surface EO and many other areas, we have taken the apporoach of trying
to estimate these state variables directly from the observations, and to
provide &#8216;products&#8217;, such as those developed and distributed by national Space Agencies
and other organisations to users. This is a laudable and valid aim and has been
practically achievable since the start of this millenium. It has allowed &#8216;end users&#8217;
access to vast amount of information that have made significant contributions to
monitoring and understanding how the Earth System &#8216;works&#8217; and what the impacts of people and climate
(as major influencing factors) have been.</p>
<p>These products have, in the main, been developed to provide consistent datasets from a single
source of information. So, for example, a global leaf area index (LAI, the amount of one sided
leaf area per unit ground area) dataset is generated by
<a class="reference external" href="http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/lai.htm">NASA from the MODIS intrument</a> and others from projects such
as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geoland2.eu">Geoland2</a> from the EU. There are many practical reasons
for developing such products using data from individual satellite sensors, but each
product has its own set of issues which the developers try to quantify and encapsulate
in quality assurace (QA) information. This is generally available for each spatial and
temporal sample in the dataset, but at the moment, it is more difficult to know what
the uncertainty of any particular observation might be.
There has been much work on &#8216;validating&#8217; and (inter-)comparing these products
to try to gauge how well they agree, but it it problematic to combine them without loss of information.</p>
<p>Further, and potentially significant for many end users who really just want to know
the LAI over some area and time (and how good that estimate is),
each product is generated using different assumptions
about the surface they suppose to measure. If these data are to be ingested into other
models that have an LAI state, close inspection of the models used to generate the EO datasets
and those in the process models will often reveal a mis-match in the assumtpions made (e.g. concerning the
spatial distribution of vegetation elements: whether and how ther are clumped or not).
Additionally, quantifying uncertainties in the data is far from trivial as it
involves considering the impact of the whole collection of information used: the measurements,
the models used for inference etc.</p>
<p>This leads us on to a Bayesian idea of the &#8216;data&#8217; (information) we are trying
to produce. In essence, we cannot provide a &#8216;truth&#8217;, but rather an estimate of the
likely statistical distribution of the information we infer. Within such an approach,
we can combine information using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bayesrule.html">Bayes rule</a>.
This allow us to (potentially) explicitly consider and combine the various sources of
uncertainty in our mapping from EO data to information. This can include information
beyond that in the EO data themselves.</p>
<p>It is now established that an optimal blending of these different sources of
information leads to the best possible estimate of the state of the land surface.
This estimate needs to be qualified, and provide information on how uncertain
it is, or how different parts of the system co-vary.</p>
<p>Data assimilation (DA) techniques allow the combination of different sources of
information, weighted by their individual uncertainty, to provide an estimate of
the state of the land surface that is conditional on all the information that is
combined. The EOLDAS project aims to demonstrate DA techniques with satellite data
by developing a software tool that allows the exploration of DA techniques. This
requires the usage of complex physical models that explain how the scene of interest
is translated into the actual radiometric measurements, as well as ancillary
information of how some parameters may vary, either through mechanistic models
(for example, dynamic vegetation models that explain the development of vegetation
using simple rules based on typically meteorological inputs), statistical models
(for example, historical estimates of leaf area index from field measurements) or
simple constraints of the evolution of these parameters (for example, by forcing
the evolution of leaf area index to be smooth and continuous).</p>

<h2>Capabilities and Limitations of the current EOLDAS<a class="headerlink" href="#capabilities-and-limitations-of-the-current-eoldas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The EOLDAS software allows for various forms of EO and other data
to be combined to provide an optimal estimate of state variables. It requires that
the uncertainties of the input data are quantified. At present, this is limited to
an assumption that Gaussian statistics can be used to describe the uncertainty, i.e.
input data are represented by their mean value and standard deviation (or more fully
a covariance matrix, although some of the input data formats currently accepted only consider
standard deviation). This can cause problems for highly non-linear systems, especially
if the uncertainties are large, so this can be partially overcome by transforming
the representation of the state variable. Arbirtary transformations are allowed,
but a typical one would be to work with a state variable that is an exponential transformation
of the desired state variable.</p>
<p>The DA system requires a model to map from EO data (radiance or reflectance data) to
the state variables of interest (e.g. LAI). We will call such models &#8216;Observation Operators&#8217;
as they map state to observations. A few example Observation Operators are available
in this release of EOLDAS, including the
<a class="reference external" href="http://rami-benchmark.jrc.ec.europa.eu/HTML/RAMI2/MODELS/Semi-discrete/Semi-discrete.php">semi-discrete radiative transfer model</a> of

<div class="section" id="exploring-a-univariate-timeseries">
<h2>Exploring a univariate timeseries<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-a-univariate-timeseries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>EO data timeseries allow for the monitoring of the land surfaces. The data
gathered by space-borne sensors can be related to a number of parameters of interest,
such as &#8220;vegetation greenness&#8221;, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active
radiation absorbed by a canopy, etc. Monitoring how a location on the Earth&#8217;s surface
changes with respect to time is thus an important task of remote sensing. Analysing
these data is fraught with difficulties: as any other measurement technique, data
have uncertainties. Cloud cover or the choice of orbit can result in data only
being available for a few dates. The role of data assimilation (DA) is to use
these measurements, together with any other ancillary information that may be
available on the state of the land surface, to infer its true state. This inference
exercise should provide us with an idea of how much should we trust our estimate.
This document presents examples of DA techniques, using the EOLDAS prototype
software as a demonstration.</p>
<p>For the first example, we&#8217;ll consider a time series of the normalised difference
vegetation index (NDVI) over an agricultural area in southern Spain. NDVI has
been correlated with vegetation development: the index is low when the scene is
composed mostly of bare soil and rises as the crop develops. The VI drops again
as the crop senesces and is eventually harvested. It is interesting to us as an
univariate time series with quite a clear shape. We can see four years of data, with
a fallow/vegetative period cadence. We note, however, that the series is noisy,
with abrupt changes and spikes showing up. This variability arises from a
number of sources: instrument noise, different geometry acquisitions, shortcomings of
the atmospheric correction, or fast changes in the soil brightness due to rain.
Most of these factors are of little interest for the study of the vegetation, so
they are usually considered &#8220;noise&#8221;, and a number of techniques are employed to
remove this signal from the clean data.</p>
<p>The most common practice in processing such data prior to attempting an interpretation
is to apply some sort of low pass filter to the time series. The reason this
is appropriate is that we have an expectation that the progression of a
quantification of the vegetation should (in the absence of
episodic events such as harvesting or fire) should be <em>smooth</em>,
though we might not know <em>a priori</em>  how smooth we expect it to be.
In other words, there is an expectation that high frequency variability (the spiky
nature of the time series) does not happen in vegetation. A low pass filter
will remove the high frequency variability, leaving the smooth underlying time
series. Recently, the Savitzky-Golay filter has been widely employed to smoooth
timeseries of vegetation indices. The figure shows an example of the original
and filtered versions of the output.</p>
<p>[<a class="reference external" href="./plot_directive/../savitzky_golay.py">source code</a>, <a class="reference external" href="./plot_directive/../savitzky_golay.hires.png">hires.png</a>, <a class="reference external" href="./plot_directive/../savitzky_golay.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
<img alt="_images/savitzky_golay.png" src="_images/savitzky_golay.png" />
<p>Note that the filtering relies on specifying its characteristics: what
constitutes high frequency noise and how much does it need to be dampened by? The problem
may be that we smooth too much or too little. The choice of parameters, in the
absence of knowledge of the rate of change of things in the land surface is therefore
problematic.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of issues to consider departures from simple smoothing
of vegetation index data, although we will return to the concept of expectation of
smoothness below:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Vegetation indices are quite limited in their information content.</li>
<li>Some of the non-smooth variation artefacts (such as acquisition geometry) can be explained by using suitable models. They are not noise, but useful signal.</li>
<li>A single univariate datum only gives a limited insight into the state of the land surface. Physical-based models can be used to tease out the contributions of different processes within the scene.</li>
<li>Thermal noise in the signal is usually well-characterised, and this knowledge has not yet been used.</li>
<li>Different processes that affect the signal of interest evolve at different rates, so different filtering mechanisms could compete. This is even more pronounced when using vegetation indices, where all the information is projected into a single scalar magnitude.</li>
<li>Without an understanding of the underlying signal, it is quite arbitrary to define appropriate filter characteristics for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons why we may want to move away from simple
filtering of vegetation indices for understanding the land surface, although
VIs provide a powerful insight into (spatial and temporal) patterns of
vegetation activity. We will
introduce concepts of data assimilation and apply them to the problem of
retrieving land surface parameters from optical sensors. For starters, we will
still use a univariate time series, but will add increasing complexity to deal
with different wavebands, the effect of the atmosphere and how we inject
physical
knowledge to the whole process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filtering-and-optimisation">
<h2>Filtering and optimisation<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-and-optimisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have seen that filtering a time series produces results that are &#8216;easier&#8217; to
interpret by reducing noise contributions to the signal. Additional insight is
gained by noting that the desirable goal of removing high frequency components
in the signal can be seen as equivalent of ensuring the signal is constrained to
have relatively  small changes between consecutive time steps. This is
equivalent to saying that the best reconstruction of the original signal is the
one where the timeseries&#8217; first (or higher order) derivatives are small. They
are small, but not zero, as zero would imply a constant valued signal.</p>
<p>Relating this to ideas in (biogeochemical) process models, having &#8216;minimal
first order derivatives&#8217; is equivalent to a zero-order process model (i.e.
the expectation is that the state tomorrow is the same as today, with some
degree of uncertainty on that). Similarly, a first order process model
(an expectation of constant rate of change) is the same as minimising
second order derivatives.</p>
<p>If then we had an estimate of the signal&#8217;s noise level, we could phrase the
smoothing problem as a trade-off between &#8220;signal fidelity&#8221; and &#8220;expectation of
smoothness&#8221;. Graphically, the reconstructed signal would be the one that, while
still staying within the errorbars of the measurements, gives the most smooth
trajectory. Clearly, the observation and smoothness terms would need to be
balanced properly. Further,
we need to fit in uncertainty in the observations and in our prior smoothness
expectation into the problem formulation.</p>
<p>A first approach would assume that
each individual measurement in contaminated by independent Gaussian noise with
a variance <span class="math">\(\sigma^{2}_{obs}\)</span>. Stacking the uncertainties into a
covariance
matrix <span class="math">\(C_{obs}\)</span>, we can write the contribution of the observation
mismatch
to our problem as <span class="math">\(J_{obs}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[J_{obs} = (1/2) (\mathbf{y_{obs}} - H(\mathbf{x}))^{T} (\mathbf{C_{obs}}^{-1}+\mathbf{C_{H}}^{-1}) (\mathbf{y_{obs}} -H(\mathbf{x} )),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is our estimate of the true value of the state (i.e. what we would like to estimate)
and <span class="math">\(y_{obs}\)</span> is an observation. The operator <span class="math">\(H(\mathbf{x})\)</span> maps from the space of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> to the space of <span class="math">\(y_{obs}\)</span>. In the general case, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C_{H}}^{-1}\)</span> is the uncertainty in the result of the operator <span class="math">\(H(\mathbf{x})\)</span>.
We will ignore <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C_{H}}^{-1}\)</span> in the discussion below, as the current implementation of EOLDAS
considers only <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C_{obs}}^{-1}\)</span>, although it can be easily re-introduced into the expressions.</p>
<p>This is a very general expression, and we will see that it is this core equation that is at the heart of the DA system in EOLDAS.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the observation we are concerned with is our e.g. time series VI signal, so <span class="math">\(y_{obs}\)</span>
is a vector with elements equal to a stack of the VI data. We have already stated that <span class="math">\(C_{obs}\)</span> is the
uncertainty associated with this observation.</p>
<p>Since our state vector (i.e. what we want to estimate) is in the same space as the observations we can use
an Identity operator for <span class="math">\(H(\mathbf{x})\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(H(\mathbf{x}) = I(\mathbf{x})\)</span>.
Another way of expressing this is to suggest that <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is a <em>prior</em> estimate of the state variables
that we wish to estimate, so we can call this a Prior Operator:</p>
<div class="math">
\[J_{prior} = (1/2) (\mathbf{y_{obs}} - I(\mathbf{x}))^{T} \mathbf{C_{obs}}^{-1} (\mathbf{y_{obs}} -I(\mathbf{x} )),\]</div>
<p>We wish to find the values of  <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> that give the minimum of <span class="math">\(J_{obs}\)</span>, but the constraint
with the identity operator is insufficient as the optimisation will result in the estimated state being the same as the
input signal.</p>
<p>To express the condition of smoothness, we can encode that, for
example, the signal change between consecutive time steps can be also
be expressed through a Gaussian  distribution with variance
<span class="math">\(\sigma^{2}_{smooth}\)</span>. The difference between time steps can be
calculated by introducing a first order differential operator matrix
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{\Delta}\)</span> with the following form:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\left(\begin{matrix} a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d \end{matrix}\right)\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\mathbf{\Delta} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
 1      &amp; -1     &amp;  0     &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
 0      &amp; 1      &amp; -1     &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
 0      &amp; 0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; -1\\
 \end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Stacking again the variances into a a covariance matrix, we can now define
<span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[J_{smooth} = (1/2)  \gamma^{2} (\mathbf{\Delta x})^{T}\mathbf{C_{smooth}}^{-1}(\mathbf{\Delta x)}.\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is a term controlling the degree of smoothness: the higher it is
the smoother the result will be. Since we can consider a constraint with a first order differential model
as a zero-order process model (i.e. tomorrow is the same as today), we can phrase the
inverse of <span class="math">\(\gamma^{2}\)</span> as the (squared) expectation of that process model: the expectation that,
on average over the whole dataset, tomorrow will be the same as today. It is interesting
to note that a zeroth order process model (a constraint of first order derivatives)
provides a linear interpolation between sample points.</p>
<p>Note that since we can sometimes assume <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C_{smooth}}\)</span> to be diagonal, this
particular
functional can be written as</p>
<div class="math">
\[J_{smooth} = (1/2) \gamma^2 \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \frac{(x^{i} - x^{i-1})^2}{\sigma_{smooth}^{2}}.\]</div>
<p>In other words, if the evolution of the signal is smooth (i.e., little change
between timesteps, relative to <span class="math">\(\sigma_{smooth}\)</span>), then
<span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span>
will be small. On the contrary, large and frequent changes between timesteps
(again relative to <span class="math">\(\sigma_{smooth}\)</span>) will result in a large contribution
to <span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note also that we can replace the differential operators above by arbitrary
orders of differential operators. A second order constraint replaces
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{\Delta}\)</span> in the above by <span class="math">\(\mathbf{\Delta^2}\)</span>, for example
and has the attraction of smoothly interpolating between sample points, rather than
the piecewise linear result one gets from a first order derivative constraint.</p>
<p>We can extend the idea of smoothness expectation to other expectations that we
might have about the signal prior to the data being available. These
expectations
will include signal bounds, smoothness over other different time scales, and
perhaps
an expectation of what the trajectory of the signal is, either from historical
data
or from the predictions of an ecosystem model. <span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span> states that we
want a fit to the &#8220;model&#8221; predictions (in our example, the &#8220;model&#8221; basically
states
that the state does not change between timesteps), but we are quite happy to
depart
from this assumption if that provides a tighter fit to the observations.
When we introduce <span class="math">\(\sigma_{smooth}\)</span>, we introduce the concept that our expectation
or state vector model has an error, and tightly fitting to it is thus
undesirable.</p>
<p>So we have seen that we want to find an optimum in terms of <span class="math">\(J_{obs}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span>. We define a function, <span class="math">\(J\)</span>, the cost function, as the
sum of both terms:</p>
<div class="math">
\[J = J_{smooth} + J_{obs}\]</div>
<p>The minimum of <span class="math">\(J\)</span> will fit both the observations and our prior
expectation
of the model state. If we ignore <span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span>, we simply have a typical least
squares problem, which may be indeterminate if the information content of the
observations is not enough to constrain a unique solution (which is generally the case).</p>
<p>The extra constraint
of <span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span> can be seen as a factor that &#8216;simplifies&#8217; the problem,
reducing the solution space, and making it &#8216;easier&#8217; to solve. We can call this
approach &#8216;regularisation&#8217; as it helps to make the problem &#8216;more regular&#8217; and
tractable.</p>
<p>There is an obvious balance between our expectation of the signal
(<span class="math">\(J_{smooth}\)</span>)
and our fidelity to the observations (<span class="math">\(J_{obs}\)</span>), but we should
not generally over-concerned with that: we do not want to over-fit the observations
in any case because we understand them to have (random) error associated with them.
The optimal solution will
be dependent on the balance between <span class="math">\(\sigma_{obs}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\sigma_{smooth}\)</span>.
While the former may be available from apparatus calibration or ancillary
measurements, the latter tends to be unknown or difficult to elucidate. We shall
see what ways we have of identifying this parameter later on.</p>

<h2>The problems the EOLDAS can solve<a class="headerlink" href="#the-problems-the-eoldas-can-solve" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The EOLDAS prototype solves problems similar to the one expressed above. In
general,
these are termed 4DVAR problems with a weak constraint. Additionally, it is also
possible to solve 4DVAR problems with strong constraint (this basically means
that
<span class="math">\(\sigma_{smooth}=0\)</span>, i.e., we trust that the solution lies fully in the
space of our expectatons. We also note that we can add more terms to <span class="math">\(J\)</span>
to encode extra information about it. This is the core idea in a variational DA system:
we can add constraints to the solution to express what we &#8216;know&#8217; that might
influence our estimate, provided we know something of the uncertainty.</p>
<p>So for example, we can encode that the
solution should fit the observations, be smooth and follow a trend not too
dissimilar to that given by a historical expectation. The problem is then posed
as</p>
<div class="math">
\[J_{smooth}(\mathbf{x}) + J_{obs}(\mathbf{x}) + \dots = \min(\mathbf{x})\]</div>
<p>This type of problems require the use of optimisation techniques, which can be
computationally very expensive. To some degree, the use of the derivatives of
the
cost functionals alleviates this cost, so in the next sections, it will be
assumed
that the derivative of the function to minimise is known, either because it has
been calculated explicitly or because a numerical approximation can be
estimated.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the minumimum of <span class="math">\(J\)</span> occurs when its derivative is zero.
Since <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> generally has multiple elements (it is a vector) we desire
the partial derivatives of <span class="math">\(J\)</span> with respect to <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> to be zero.</p>
